                <header>About Gears of Wario</header>
                <p>Wario had always been a man of means. As a wealthy entrepreneur and master thief, he had always been able to acquire whatever he wanted through cunning, guile, and the occasional bit of brute force. But when he found himself stranded on the planet of Sera, he realized that even his vast resources might not be enough to keep him alive.<br>

                  The world of Sera was a harsh and unforgiving place, torn apart by endless wars between rival factions. And at the heart of it all lay the Locust Horde, a monstrous race of creatures that seemed determined to wipe out all human life on the planet.<br>
                  
                  Wario knew that he needed to find allies if he was going to survive in this hostile environment. And so he sought out the only people who seemed to have any hope of standing up to the Locust - the elite soldiers of the Coalition of Ordered Governments, better known as the COG.<br>
                  
                  At first, the COG soldiers were wary of Wario. They had heard of his reputation as a mercenary and a thief, and they didn't trust him to fight alongside them. But Wario was nothing if not persuasive, and he soon convinced the COG leaders that his skills and resources would be invaluable in the fight against the Locust.<br>
                  
                  And so Wario found himself fighting alongside the COG soldiers, battling against wave after wave of Locust attacks. He quickly proved himself to be a fierce and capable warrior, using his immense strength and cunning to outmaneuver the enemy and turn the tide of battle.<br>
                  
                  But Wario soon discovered that the Locust were not the only threat on Sera. There were other factions vying for power in this war-torn world, and they saw Wario and the COG as a threat to their own plans for domination.<br>
                  
                  In one particularly brutal battle, Wario and his COG allies found themselves surrounded by a massive army of heavily-armed mercenaries. The odds seemed impossible, but Wario refused to back down. With a roar of defiance, he charged into battle, his chainsaw-equipped assault rifle tearing through the enemy ranks.<br>
                  
                  In the end, Wario and the COG emerged victorious, but at a heavy cost. Wario himself had been badly wounded, his body riddled with bullet holes and cuts from the mercenary's blades.<br>
                  
                  But Wario was not one to give up easily. With the help of the COG's medical teams, he fought his way back to health, ready to continue the fight against the Locust and any other enemies that might come his way.<br>
                  
                  For Wario had discovered that there was something deeply satisfying about fighting for a cause greater than his own personal gain. In a world as brutal and unforgiving as Sera, he had found a sense of purpose and camaraderie that he had never experienced before. And he knew that he would fight to protect that feeling, no matter what the cost</p>
