				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<p>The Underbelly is the ultimate place for gamers as we have combined all platforms of gaming into one! The seperation of PC player and console players will no longer be a gap to play with friends or family.<br>
			Please note this is not a real site and any games shown are not real and using AI art. This is for a collage project and not meant to be taken seriously, no buy or login bottons will work.<br>
			This is my idea of what platforms may look like while selling all types of game even from consoles such as nintendo and play-station. All work has been done by me. To the honour of gaming I have hidden<br>
			a secret in the site(no reward will be given for finding this secret but enjoy the search!)<br>
			HINT: Its as easy as <b>DRAGGING</b> and dropping files to find!</p>
