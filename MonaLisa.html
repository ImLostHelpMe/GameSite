                <p>In this game, you play as Luigi, who has decided to take matters into his own hands and steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre museum in Paris. It's up to you to guide Luigi through the treacherous halls of the museum and help him make his escape with the priceless painting.<br>

                  But it won't be easy. You'll have to avoid security cameras, motion detectors, and guards who are patrolling the halls. Use your wits and your trusty green shell to outsmart your enemies and get the Mona Lisa out of the museum.<br>
                  
                  As you progress through the game, you'll encounter various obstacles, like locked doors and guard dogs. But fear not - Luigi has a few tricks up his sleeve. He can use his ghost-like abilities to disappear and reappear in a different location, and he can use his fire flower to blast through any obstacles in his way.<br>
                  
                  And of course, no Mario Bros. game would be complete without power-ups. Collect coins to unlock new abilities, like the ability to fly with a cape or shoot fireballs from your hands.<br>
                  
                  But be warned - the Louvre is a vast and complicated maze, and one wrong move could mean game over. Will you be able to guide Luigi to victory and steal the Mona Lisa? Or will you get caught by the guards and spend the rest of your days in a French prison?<br>
                  
                  It's up to you to find out in Luigi's Mona Lisa Heist! </p>
