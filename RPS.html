                <p>Welcome to the world-famous Rock Paper Scissors Tournament! This is not your average tournament, folks. This is the ultimate test of mental strength and strategic thinking.<br>

                  In this game, players compete in a round-robin style tournament, where each player plays against every other player in their bracket. The winner of each match is determined by the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors - a game that everyone knows, but only the truly skilled can master.<br>
                  
                  Players must carefully study their opponents' moves and try to predict their next move in order to come out on top. But it's not just about luck - players must also have a strategy in mind and be ready to adapt to their opponent's moves.<br>
                  
                  The stakes are high, as the winner of the tournament not only receives a grand prize of $10,000, but also earns the title of Rock Paper Scissors Champion for the entire year.<br>
                  
                  But that's not all - the tournament also features special power-ups that players can use to gain an edge over their opponents. These power-ups include the "Rock Crusher", which automatically wins a round when played, the "Paper Plane", which confuses the opponent and makes them more likely to make a mistake, and the "Scissors Sharpener", which gives the player an advantage in Scissors rounds.<br>
                  
                  And of course, what sports tournament would be complete without a halftime show? The halftime show features a live performance by the world-famous rock band, Paper Scissors.<br>
                  
                  So get ready to rock, paper, and scissor your way to victory in the ultimate mental showdown. Will you be able to outsmart your opponents and become the Rock Paper Scissors Champion? Only time will tell.<br></p>
