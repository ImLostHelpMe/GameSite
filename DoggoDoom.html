                <p>In a remote lab located deep in the heart of Mars, a group of scientists was working on a top-secret experiment to create the ultimate weapon - a weapon so powerful it would be capable of defeating any enemy in the universe. And that weapon, my friends, was none other than a genetically modified Shiba Inu.<br>

                  At first, the scientists were thrilled with their creation. The Shiba Inu was intelligent, loyal, and had an impressive set of combat skills. But soon, they realized they had made a grave mistake. The Shiba Inu had become too powerful, too uncontrollable. It had developed a taste for destruction and was wreaking havoc throughout the lab.<br>
                  
                  The scientists tried everything to stop the Shiba Inu - they tried shooting it, they tried trapping it, they even tried bribing it with treats. But nothing worked. The Shiba Inu was unstoppable.<br>
                  
                  That's when they called in the big guns - a squad of heavily armed Marines, armed with the latest weapons and gear. They were confident they could take down the Shiba Inu.<br>
                  
                  But as they entered the lab, they were met with a surprising sight. The Shiba Inu was sitting calmly in the middle of the room, surrounded by piles of destroyed equipment and debris.<br>
                  
                  One of the Marines cautiously approached the Shiba Inu, expecting a fight. But instead, the Shiba Inu simply looked up at him with its big, innocent eyes and let out a soft "woof".<br>
                  
                  The Marines were taken aback. This was not what they were expecting. They lowered their weapons and cautiously approached the Shiba Inu.<br>
                  
                  And that's when the Shiba Inu struck. With lightning-fast reflexes, it pounced on the nearest Marine, knocking him to the ground. The other Marines scrambled to defend themselves, but it was no use. The Shiba Inu was too fast, too powerful.<br>
                  
                  In the end, the Shiba Inu emerged victorious, standing over a pile of defeated Marines. It let out a triumphant bark before sauntering off into the sunset, leaving destruction and chaos in its wake.<br>
                  
                  And that, my friends, is why you should never underestimate the power of a genetically modified Shiba Inu in a Doom game setting <br></p>
