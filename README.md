Web Authoring Project – The Underbelly 

The 5 Planes 

Strategy 

The history of the business area around selling games on digital platforms like Steam can be traced back to the early 2000s when Valve Corporation, a prominent video game developer, recognized the potential of the internet as a distribution platform for games. At the time, physical copies of games dominated the market, but Valve saw an opportunity to create a digital marketplace for games that could be downloaded and played directly on a user's computer. 

In 2003, Valve launched Steam, a digital distribution platform that allowed users to purchase and download games directly onto their computer. Steam quickly gained popularity among gamers, offering a vast library of games from both large and small developers, often at discounted prices. As more games were added to the platform, Steam became an increasingly important source of revenue for developers, particularly for indie game developers who may not have had the resources to market and distribute their games through traditional channels. 

As the popularity of Steam grew, other digital platforms entered the market, such as GOG.com, Origin, and the Epic Games Store. These platforms offered similar services to Steam, but with different pricing models and exclusive deals with developers. The competition between these platforms has created a vibrant marketplace for games, with developers having more options than ever to distribute their products. 

Using that, I know that gaming platforms are profitable and that’s why I went with this business idea and its main way to draw gamers, professionals and casuals is by combining all the platforms to stop the gaming crisis of to play Ubisoft game you need Ubisoft connect (one of the worst platforms, hated by all people). This is or would be the main selling point. 

The target audience for the Underbelly is primarily gamers who enjoy playing video games on their computer. The Underbelly’s audience would be diverse in terms of age, gender, and geographic location, but they share a common interest in gaming. The gaming audience can be further segmented into several subgroups, including: Core gamers, casual gamers, Competitive gamers and game developers. Overall, the target audience for The Underbelly is anyone who is interested in playing video games on their computer, regardless of their level of experience or gaming preferences.  

 

The target audience for a website like The Underbelly would typically be gamers who are interested in purchasing and playing video games on their computer. A game platforms primary audience would tend to be individuals who are passionate about gaming and are looking for a wide range of games to choose from. some of the things that the target audience might might want from a game platform would be  

A wide selection of games, sales and discounts and regular updates. Overall, the target audience for a website like The Underbelly is looking for a platform that offers a wide range of games, easy navigation, and community features that allow them to connect with other gamers. They also want regular updates and sales that make it easy and affordable to access the games they love. 

The objectives of the Underbelly are to provide a platform for gamers to purchase, download, and play video games on their computers. The Underbelly would try to offer a wide range of games. Provide a user friendly platform to keep new comers and old users. Offer competitive pricing and the main objective would be to generate profits and ensure the game developers and publishers are happy on this site. 

,  

A list of business goals for The Underbelly would be to generate revenue through game sales. To achieve this, I would take a percentage of the amount the game would be sold for, this would allow me to generate profits and keep ads of the website keeping new users and experienced users. 

Increase user engagement by offering new games, features, and community activities. This can lead to more frequent visits to the website and most importantly, more revenue. 

Attract and retain game developers I would do this by offering tools, resources, and support to help them create and distribute their games on the platform. This can lead to more games being published on The Underbelly, which can in turn attract more users and money. 

Provide a safe and secure platform. This would create trust with game developers and users making them more comfortable to spend money. 

Scope 

The Content in the website is on the right a notice informing people that the website is not real and its only purpose is for a collage project, then to the left is where all the games are put on display for the user to “purchase and play”. On the top of the website is the navigation where they can see tags and, go to my socials and go to my about page where I have hidden an easter egg in honour of gaming. 

Structure 

I will structure the website with there being a navigation bar on the top as well as the websites name (The Underbelly), the navigation bar will have an about, socials tab and a home page for easier returns, the logo that’s on the left to the navigation bar will also take you to the home page when pressed on. 

 

I will organize my content by using tags such as Top selling, Top Rated. There will also be tag pages including story games, shooters and such. The sites information will be in the about page describing what the site is meant for and why and it will be arranged in such a way that the sites main information will be show first with a FAQ under it. The way it will be presented is by images of the game box art then when it it is clicked it will show the game name, screenshots of said game and an about on the right side. 

Skeleton 

This is the wireframe for the main page(some changes have been made since) 

 

This is the about page wireframe 

 

This is the game purchase page where I used a template that I made, and copy pasted and filled out all game purchase pages are using the same CSS 

 

This is the error 404 page for when user try to log in. 

 

Surface 

The landing page was my priority page as it’s the landing page so to entice “users” to use my site I had filled it with the most top-rated games (games are not real due to copyright issues). Since it is not a real site for games I wanted people looking at it to know so I had added a notice on the right side. I was trying to make my website design dark since most gamers prefer it and I used white writing to make it more visible. I used purple to let users know it’s a link. 

Tool Selection 

The tools I used are studio visual code, draw.io, MS paint, mouse, keyboard, 4k,1080p and 720p monitors, over speced pc and Microsoft word/OneDrive. 

Test Case 

To test my website, I tested it on 3 different platforms such as google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft edge. I was mostly testing for positioning and resolution.
