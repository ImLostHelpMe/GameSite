                <header>About Mario Wars</header>
                <p>Mario had always been up for a challenge, but when he found himself transported to the hellish world of Doom, he wasn't quite sure what to make of it.<br>

                  The world around him was dark and foreboding, with flames licking at every corner and grotesque demons lurking in every shadow. Mario had faced his fair share of enemies before, but these were unlike anything he had ever encountered.<br>
                  
                  Still, Mario was nothing if not determined. He had a mission to complete, and he wasn't going to let a few pesky demons stand in his way.<br>
                  
                  With a fierce look in his eye, Mario set out into the unknown, his trusty plumber's tool belt at his side. He knew that he would need all his wits and skills to survive in this hostile environment, but he was ready for the challenge.<br>
                  
                  And then he saw it - a massive demon, towering over him like a giant. Its eyes glowed with an unholy fire, and its sharp teeth glinted in the dim light.<br>
                  
                  Mario gulped. He had faced some pretty tough bosses in his time, but this was something else entirely.<br>
                  
                  But Mario was not one to back down from a challenge. With a roar of determination, he leaped into action, his trusty red cap flapping in the breeze.<br>
                  
                  He darted around the demon, dodging its massive claws and leaping over its powerful tail. He pulled out a plunger from his tool belt and threw it at the demon's head, causing it to stagger back in surprise.<br>
                  
                  And then, with a burst of energy, Mario pulled out a Super Mushroom and gobbled it down, growing to twice his normal size. The demon was caught off guard, and Mario used the opportunity to deliver a powerful punch to its face.<br>
                  
                  The demon howled in pain, its massive body shaking with fury. But Mario was not done yet. He pulled out a fire flower and unleashed a barrage of fiery projectiles at the demon, causing it to stagger back even further.<br>
                  
                  And then, with one final leap, Mario delivered the finishing blow, slamming his fist into the demon's face with all his might.<br>
                  
                  The demon let out a final shriek of pain, and then it collapsed to the ground in a heap. Mario stood victorious, a grin on his face.<br>
                  
                  He may have been a plumber from the Mushroom Kingdom, but in the world of Doom, he was a force to be reckoned with. </p>
